# Percolation Centrality: a critical review
In this project, we critically investigate the paper [Percolation Centrality: Quantifying Graph-Theoretic Impact of Nodes during Percolation in Networks](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053095), reproducing its main results, criticizing and extending it.

Our main findings and experiments are summarized in our [report](./report.pdf) and [presentation](./Percolation_centrality.pptx).

This work is part of an assignment for the course "Networks Out of Control" (**Models and methods for random networks**) at EPFL, and is the joint effort of [Francesco Salvi](https://github.com/frasalvi) and [Neta Singer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neta-singer-6078401a6/).
